🌱 I’m currently learning about Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) and exploring C++ programming with the Eigen library.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving numerical methods, software development for engineering applications, and advanced data analysis techniques.
📫 How to reach me: rubayet.jahan@iitgn.ac.in
